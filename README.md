# Central Asia Fault Database
## Description
This was the largest project of my apprenticeship at the University of TÃ¼bingen, which ended in 2015.
It is a interactive map of Central Asia displaying various faults, earthquake catalogs, and additional data.
The main feature is the ability to overlay fault locations and earthquakes.
Faults can be clicked for additional information, and there is also a search function.
The links below provide access to the scientific paper as well as the map itself.
