<h2>Earthquake Education Video Library</h2>
<p>The earthquake education video library contains learning videos created by our research group as well as scientists from universities across the United Kingdom to raise awareness of earthquake hazards and to address knowledge gaps and misunderstandings. The production of these videos was funded by the European Geoscience Union Public Engagement Grant to Solmaz Mohadjer. To view the videos, please visit the <a href="<?php echo $url_outreach; ?>">Education and Outreach</a> page of our research group.</p><br />
